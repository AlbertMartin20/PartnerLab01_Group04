    """Play the Guessing Game.
    
    The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
    The player has 5 tries to guess the number. After each guess,
    the program provides hints:
        - "Too high/Too low" if the guess is far off (difference > 10).
        - "High/Low" if the guess is close (difference â‰¤ 10).
    
    Special Features:
        - If the player guesses correctly on the first try, a jackpot
          message is shown.
        - If the player guesses correctly on later tries, a congratulatory
          message is displayed.
        - If the player runs out of tries, the secret number is revealed.
    
    After each round, the player is asked if they want to play again.
